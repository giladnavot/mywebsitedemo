# What is Walker

The Walker class is a part of the WordPress core, located in the wp-includes directory. It is designed to traverse and display elements which have a hierarchical (or tree like) structure. It abstracts the process of traversing elements, and provides methods that child classes can use to provide specific HTML output. The Walker class is typically extended by other classes to generate specific types of HTML such as menus, lists and dropdowns.

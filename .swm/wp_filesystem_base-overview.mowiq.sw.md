# What is WP_Filesystem_Base

`WP_Filesystem_Base` is a base WordPress filesystem class which other filesystem implementations extend. It is part of the WordPress filesystem package and was introduced in WordPress 2.5.0. The class provides a set of methods for interacting with the filesystem, such as reading and writing files, changing permissions, and more. It is used as a foundation for other filesystem classes to build upon, providing a consistent set of functionalities for all filesystem operations in WordPress.

The `abspath` function returns the path on the remote filesystem of `ABSPATH`. It finds the folder of `ABSPATH` and checks if the FTP folder is rooted at the WordPress install.

```hack
	public function abspath() {
		$folder = $this->find_folder( ABSPATH );

		/*
		 * Perhaps the FTP folder is rooted at the WordPress install.
		 * Check for wp-includes folder in root. Could have some false positives, but rare.
		 */
		if ( ! $folder && $this->is_dir( '/' . WPINC ) ) {
			$folder = '/';
		}

		return $folder;
	}
```

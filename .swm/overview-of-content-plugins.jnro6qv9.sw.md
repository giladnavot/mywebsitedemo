title: Overview of Content Plugins
---
Content Plugins in <SwmToken path="/wp-content/plugins/hello.php" pos="8:7:7" line-data="Plugin URI: http://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/">`wordpress`</SwmToken>, such as those found in the <SwmPath>[wp-content/plugins//](/wp-content/plugins//)</SwmPath> directory, are pieces of software that add specific features or functionalities to the website. They are written in PHP and integrate seamlessly with <SwmToken path="/wp-content/plugins/hello.php" pos="8:7:7" line-data="Plugin URI: http://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/">`wordpress`</SwmToken>. These plugins allow for customization and control over the website, extending the core functionality of <SwmToken path="/wp-content/plugins/hello.php" pos="8:7:7" line-data="Plugin URI: http://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/">`wordpress`</SwmToken>.

For instance, the 'Hello Dolly' plugin, when activated, displays lyrics from the song 'Hello, Dolly' in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.

```hack
<?php
/**
 * @package Hello_Dolly
 * @version 1.7.2
 */
/*
Plugin Name: Hello Dolly
Plugin URI: http://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/
Description: This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation summed up in two words sung most famously by Louis Armstrong: Hello, Dolly. When activated you will randomly see a lyric from <cite>Hello, Dolly</cite> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.

Another example is the 'Akismet' plugin, which helps protect your blog from spam. It modifies its own description based on whether it's active and properly configured or not.

```hack
	/**
	 * When Akismet is active, remove the "Activate Akismet" step from the plugin description.
	 */
	public static function modify_plugin_description( $all_plugins ) {
		if ( isset( $all_plugins['akismet/akismet.php'] ) ) {
			if ( Akismet::get_api_key() ) {
				$all_plugins['akismet/akismet.php']['Description'] = __( 'Used by millions, Akismet is quite possibly the best way in the world to <strong>protect your blog from spam</strong>. Your site is fully configured and being protected, even while you sleep.', 'akismet' );
			}
			else {
				$all_plugins['akismet/akismet.php']['Description'] = __( 'Used by millions, Akismet is quite possibly the best way in the world to <strong>protect your blog from spam</strong>. It keeps your site protected even while you sleep. To get started, just go to <a href="admin.php?page=akismet-key-config">your Akismet Settings page</a> to set up your API key.', 'akismet' );
			}
		}

		return $all_plugins;
	}
```

# Hello Dolly Plugin

The 'Hello Dolly' plugin is an example of a content plugin. It adds a random lyric from the song 'Hello, Dolly' to the admin screen of the <SwmToken path="/wp-content/plugins/hello.php" pos="8:7:7" line-data="Plugin URI: http://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/">`wordpress`</SwmToken> website. The plugin is activated by adding an action to the <SwmToken path="/wp-content/plugins/hello.php" pos="68:22:22" line-data="// Now we set that function up to execute when the admin_notices action is called.">`admin_notices`</SwmToken> hook, which is triggered when the admin screen is displayed.

```hack
<?php
/**
 * @package Hello_Dolly
 * @version 1.7.2
 */
/*
Plugin Name: Hello Dolly
Plugin URI: http://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/
Description: This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation summed up in two words sung most famously by Louis Armstrong: Hello, Dolly. When activated you will randomly see a lyric from <cite>Hello, Dolly</cite> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.

*/

function hello_dolly_get_lyric() {
	/** These are the lyrics to Hello Dolly */
	$lyrics = "Hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly

# Akismet Plugin

The 'Akismet' plugin is another example of a content plugin. It provides a REST API for interacting with the Akismet service, which helps protect the website from spam. The plugin registers several routes with the <SwmToken path="/wp-content/plugins/hello.php" pos="8:7:7" line-data="Plugin URI: http://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/">`wordpress`</SwmToken> REST API, each of which corresponds to a different function of the Akismet service.

```hack
class Akismet_REST_API {
	/**
	 * Register the REST API routes.
	 */
	public static function init() {
		if ( ! function_exists( 'register_rest_route' ) ) {
			// The REST API wasn't integrated into core until 4.4, and we support 4.0+ (for now).
			return false;
		}

		register_rest_route( 'akismet/v1', '/key', array(
			array(
				'methods' => WP_REST_Server::READABLE,
				'permission_callback' => array( 'Akismet_REST_API', 'privileged_permission_callback' ),
				'callback' => array( 'Akismet_REST_API', 'get_key' ),
			), array(
				'methods' => WP_REST_Server::EDITABLE,
				'permission_callback' => array( 'Akismet_REST_API', 'privileged_permission_callback' ),
				'callback' => array( 'Akismet_REST_API', 'set_key' ),
				'args' => array(
					'key' => array(

# Modifying Plugin Descriptions

This function in the Akismet plugin modifies the description of the plugin that is displayed in the <SwmToken path="/wp-content/plugins/hello.php" pos="8:7:7" line-data="Plugin URI: http://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/">`wordpress`</SwmToken> admin panel. This is an example of how a plugin can modify the <SwmToken path="/wp-content/plugins/hello.php" pos="8:7:7" line-data="Plugin URI: http://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/">`wordpress`</SwmToken> admin interface.

```hack
	/**
	 * When Akismet is active, remove the "Activate Akismet" step from the plugin description.
	 */
	public static function modify_plugin_description( $all_plugins ) {
		if ( isset( $all_plugins['akismet/akismet.php'] ) ) {
			if ( Akismet::get_api_key() ) {
				$all_plugins['akismet/akismet.php']['Description'] = __( 'Used by millions, Akismet is quite possibly the best way in the world to <strong>protect your blog from spam</strong>. Your site is fully configured and being protected, even while you sleep.', 'akismet' );
			}
			else {
				$all_plugins['akismet/akismet.php']['Description'] = __( 'Used by millions, Akismet is quite possibly the best way in the world to <strong>protect your blog from spam</strong>. It keeps your site protected even while you sleep. To get started, just go to <a href="admin.php?page=akismet-key-config">your Akismet Settings page</a> to set up your API key.', 'akismet' );
			}
		}

		return $all_plugins;

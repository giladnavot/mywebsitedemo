The `id` variable is a unique string identifier for the setting. It's used to differentiate each setting.

	 * @since 3.4.0

The `type` variable is used to define the type of the settings. It defaults to 'theme_mod'.

```hack
	/**
	 * Type of customize settings.
	 *
	 * @since 3.4.0
	 * @var string
	 */

The `save` function checks user capabilities and theme supports, and then saves the value of the setting. It returns false if the capability check fails or the value isn't set or is invalid.

```hack
	final public function save() {
		$value = $this->post_value();

		if ( ! $this->check_capabilities() || ! isset( $value ) ) {
			return false;
		}

		$id_base = $this->id_data['base'];

		/**
		 * Fires when the WP_Customize_Setting::save() method is called.
		 *
		 * The dynamic portion of the hook name, `$id_base` refers to
		 * the base slug of the setting name.
		 *
		 * @since 3.4.0
		 *
		 * @param WP_Customize_Setting $setting WP_Customize_Setting instance.
		 */
		do_action( "customize_save_{$id_base}", $this );

```

The `value` function fetches the value of the setting. It returns the value of the setting.

```hack
	/**
	 * Fetch the value of the setting.
	 *
	 * @since 3.4.0
	 *
	 * @return mixed The value.
	 */
	public function value() {
		$id_base      = $this->id_data['base'];
		$is_core_type = ( 'option' === $this->type || 'theme_mod' === $this->type );

		if ( ! $is_core_type && ! $this->is_multidimensional_aggregated ) {

			// Use post value if previewed and a post value is present.
			if ( $this->is_previewed ) {
				$value = $this->post_value( null );
				if ( null !== $value ) {
					return $value;
				}
			}

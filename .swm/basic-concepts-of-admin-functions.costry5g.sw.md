title: Basic Concepts of Admin Functions
---
Admin Functions in the WordPress project are a set of functionalities that provide the ability to manage the website. They are primarily located in the `wp-admin` directory. These functions include managing users, posts, comments, and other site settings. The `admin.php` file is the main entry point for these functions. It sets up the environment and loads the necessary resources for the admin interface. The `admin-functions.php` file, however, is deprecated and its functionalities have been moved to `wp-admin/includes/admin.php`. The admin interface also includes styles and scripts for the admin menu and other UI elements, defined in `wp-admin/css/colors/_admin.scss` and other CSS files.

# Admin Functions in wp-admin/admin.php

This file is the bootstrap for the WordPress admin. It sets up the admin environment and loads the necessary files and functions. It also defines several constants that are used in the admin interface.

```hack
<?php
/**
 * WordPress Administration Bootstrap
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage Administration
 */

/**
 * In WordPress Administration Screens
 *
 * @since 2.3.2
 */
if ( ! defined( 'WP_ADMIN' ) ) {
	define( 'WP_ADMIN', true );
}

if ( ! defined( 'WP_NETWORK_ADMIN' ) ) {
	define( 'WP_NETWORK_ADMIN', false );
}

This file contains deprecated admin functions. These functions were used in previous versions of WordPress but are no longer used. They are kept for backward compatibility.

```hack
/**

 *
 * @since 2.0.0
 * @deprecated 2.5.0
 *
 */
function documentation_link() {
	_deprecated_function( __FUNCTION__, '2.5.0' );
}

# Admin Functions in wp-admin/admin-ajax.php

This file handles Ajax requests in the WordPress admin. It defines the `DOING_AJAX` constant and loads the necessary files and functions for handling Ajax requests.

```hack
<?php
/**

 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage Administration
 *
 * @link https://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins
 */

/**
 * Executing Ajax process.
 *
 * @since 2.1.0
 */
define( 'DOING_AJAX', true );
if ( ! defined( 'WP_ADMIN' ) ) {
	define( 'WP_ADMIN', true );

# Admin Functions in wp-admin/includes/admin.php

This file loads the necessary files and functions for the WordPress admin. It includes files for handling bookmarks, comments, files, images, media, options, plugins, posts, taxonomy, templates, themes, users, updates, and more.

```hack
<?php
/**
 * Core Administration API
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage Administration
 * @since 2.3.0
 */

if ( ! defined( 'WP_ADMIN' ) ) {
	/*
	 * This file is being included from a file other than wp-admin/admin.php, so
	 * some setup was skipped. Make sure the admin message catalog is loaded since
	 * load_default_textdomain() will not have done so in this context.
	 */
	$admin_locale = get_locale();
	load_textdomain( 'default', WP_LANG_DIR . '/admin-' . $admin_locale . '.mo', $admin_locale );
	unset( $admin_locale );
}

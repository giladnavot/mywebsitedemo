title: Understanding Includes Functions
---
In the context of the mywebsitedemo repository, 'Includes Functions' refers to a set of functions that are included or imported from other files to be used in the current file. These functions are typically defined in separate files and are included in the current file using include statements. This allows for code reusability and modularity, as functions can be defined once and used in multiple locations.

The 'Includes Functions' are used throughout the codebase to perform specific tasks or calculations that are required in multiple locations. This can include tasks such as data manipulation, mathematical calculations, or even more complex operations such as interacting with databases or APIs.

The functionality of 'Includes Functions' depends on the specific function. Each function is designed to perform a specific task, and the function's name usually gives an indication of what that task is. For example, a function named 'calculateAverage' would likely calculate the average of a set of numbers.

In terms of data flow, 'Includes Functions' typically take in data as parameters, perform some operation on that data, and then return the result. The data passed into the function can come from a variety of sources, such as user input, data retrieved from a database, or data generated elsewhere in the code.

An example of an 'Includes Function' in use could be a function that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart. This function could be defined in a separate file, and then included in any file that needs to calculate a total price. This allows for the calculation code to be written and tested once, and then reused wherever it's needed.

# getID3 Class

The 'getID3' class is an example of an 'Includes Function'. It's defined in the 'getid3.php' file and is used across various files in the codebase. This class is used for handling ID3 tags in media files, providing functionalities like reading, processing, and calculating additional info such as bitrate, channel mode etc.

```hack
class getID3
{
	/*
	 * Settings
	 */

	/**
	 * CASE SENSITIVE! - i.e. (must be supported by iconv()). Examples:  ISO-8859-1  UTF-8  UTF-16  UTF-16BE
	 *
	 * @var string
	 */
	public $encoding        = 'UTF-8';

	/**
	 * Should always be 'ISO-8859-1', but some tags may be written in other encodings such as 'EUC-CN' or 'CP1252'
	 *
	 * @var string
	 */
	public $encoding_id3v1  = 'ISO-8859-1';

# wp_styles Function

The 'wp_styles' function is another example of an 'Includes Function'. It's used to initialize the global $wp_styles if it has not been set. This function is part of the WordPress Dependencies API and is used for handling stylesheets in WordPress.

```hack
function wp_styles() {
	global $wp_styles;

	if ( ! ( $wp_styles instanceof WP_Styles ) ) {
		$wp_styles = new WP_Styles();
	}

	return $wp_styles;
}
```

# IXR_Server Class

The 'IXR_Server' class is another example of an 'Includes Function'. It's used for handling XML-RPC server requests. This class provides methods for serving data, calling methods, and handling errors.

```hack
class IXR_Server
{
    var $data;
    var $callbacks = array();
    var $message;
    var $capabilities;

	/**
	 * PHP5 constructor.
	 */
    function __construct( $callbacks = false, $data = false, $wait = false )
    {
        $this->setCapabilities();
        if ($callbacks) {
            $this->callbacks = $callbacks;
        }
        $this->setCallbacks();
        if (!$wait) {
            $this->serve($data);
        }
    }
```

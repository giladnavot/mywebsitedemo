## Displaying Lyrics

This part of the code defines the `hello_dolly_get_lyric` function. This function contains the lyrics to 'Hello, Dolly', splits them into separate lines, and then randomly selects a line to display.

```hack
function hello_dolly_get_lyric() {
	/** These are the lyrics to Hello Dolly */
	$lyrics = "Hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
I feel the room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of our old favorite songs from way back when
So, take her wrap, fellas
Dolly, never go away again
Hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
```

## Activating the Plugin

This part of the code sets up the `hello_dolly` function to execute when the `admin_notices` action is called. This is how the plugin is activated and starts displaying lyrics on the admin screen.

```hack
// Now we set that function up to execute when the admin_notices action is called.
add_action( 'admin_notices', 'hello_dolly' );

```

## Styling the Display

This part of the code defines the `dolly_css` function, which adds some CSS to position the displayed lyric on the admin screen. This function is set up to execute when the `admin_head` action is called.

```hack
function dolly_css() {
	echo "
	<style type='text/css'>
	#dolly {
		float: right;
		padding: 5px 10px;
		margin: 0;
		font-size: 12px;
		line-height: 1.6666;
	}
	.rtl #dolly {
		float: left;
	}
	.block-editor-page #dolly {
		display: none;
	}
	@media screen and (max-width: 782px) {
		#dolly,
		.rtl #dolly {
			float: none;

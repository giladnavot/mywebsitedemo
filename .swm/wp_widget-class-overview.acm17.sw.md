# What is WP_Widget

`WP_Widget` is a core base class in WordPress that is extended to register widgets. Each widget must extend this class and override the `WP_Widget::widget()` method. If adding widget options, `WP_Widget::update()` and `WP_Widget::form()` should also be overridden. It was introduced in WordPress 2.8.0 and moved to its own file from `wp-includes/widgets.php` in WordPress 4.4.0.

The `widget()` function is used to echo the widget content. This function must be overridden in a subclass.

```hack
	public function widget( $args, $instance ) {
		die( 'function WP_Widget::widget() must be overridden in a subclass.' );
	}
```

<SwmSnippet path="/wp-includes/class-wp-widget.php" line="131">

---

The `update()` function is used to update a particular instance of a widget. This function should check that `$new_instance` is set correctly. The newly-calculated value of `$instance` should be returned. If false is returned, the instance won't be saved/updated.

```hack
	public function update( $new_instance, $old_instance ) {
		return $new_instance;
	}
```

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/wp-includes/class-wp-widget.php" line="143">

---

The `form()` function is used to output the settings update form. This function should be overridden in a subclass to display the form fields for the widget.

```hack
	public function form( $instance ) {
		echo '<p class="no-options-widget">' . __( 'There are no options for this widget.' ) . '</p>';
		return 'noform';
	}
```

title: Introduction to Media Management
---
Media Management in the mywebsitedemo repository refers to the handling of media files within the WordPress project. This includes actions such as uploading, updating, attaching, detaching, and deleting media files. These actions are primarily handled in the 'wp-admin/media.php' and 'wp-admin/upload.php' files.

## Media Management Action Handler

This script handles various media management actions. It's deprecated and the functionality has been moved to 'wp-admin/upload.php'. It handles actions like editing attachments and redirects to the appropriate page based on the action.

```hack
/**
 * Media management action handler.
 *
 * This file is deprecated, use 'wp-admin/upload.php' instead.
 *
 * @deprecated 6.3.0
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage Administration
 */

/** Load WordPress Administration Bootstrap. */
require_once __DIR__ . '/admin.php';

$parent_file  = 'upload.php';
$submenu_file = 'upload.php';

wp_reset_vars( array( 'action' ) );

switch ( $action ) {
	case 'editattachment':
	case 'edit':
```

## Media Library Administration Panel

This script is the main interface for Media Management. It checks user permissions, handles various actions like uploading, deleting, and restoring files, and provides feedback messages. It also sets up the Media Library page in the WordPress Administration Panel.

```hack
/**
 * Media Library administration panel.
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage Administration
 */

/** WordPress Administration Bootstrap */
require_once __DIR__ . '/admin.php';

if ( ! current_user_can( 'upload_files' ) ) {
	wp_die( __( 'Sorry, you are not allowed to upload files.' ) );
}

$message = '';
if ( ! empty( $_GET['posted'] ) ) {
	$message = __( 'Media file updated.' );

	$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] = remove_query_arg( array( 'posted' ), $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] );
	unset( $_GET['posted'] );
}
```

The title of the Media Library page is set here. This title is used in the HTML title tag when the Media Library page is displayed.

	// Used in the HTML title tag.
	$title       = __( 'Media Library' );
	$parent_file = 'upload.php';
```
